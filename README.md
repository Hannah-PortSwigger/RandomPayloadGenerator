# Random Payload Generator

An (incomplete) extension to generate Intruder payloads.

It provides a basic UI to configure settings.

Add further logic to generate the payload list in `ExtensionPayloadGenerator.java` - there is a TODO at the relevant point.

To build this extension, simply run `./gradlew jar`
